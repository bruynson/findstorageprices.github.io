    The best thing about self storage is the ability to expand your space in a matter in minutes. In Toronto, this ability is part of city living. We live in the city because of the convenience of being close to everything and escape to go camping, kayaking, biking, or boating on weekends. But in Toronto space is limited, so having a place to put those weekend types is uber important for us city folk. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Self Storage facilities in Toronto have the luxury of so much variety. There are self storage facilities that specialize in drive-up units, climate control, safety and security, pickup and delivery of your belongings to your front door, and even storage facilities that specialize in the customer experience which have couches, coffee, and fireplaces in the lobby of the Self Storage facility
    <br>
    <br>
    In addition to having the very best that Self Storage has to offer, Toronto has plenty of events, activities, and sights to see for the Toronto homeowner. Nestled alongside of Lake Ontario, Toronto is the hub for commerce in Canada. With access to all major road arteries in Ontario including the 401, 407, 412, 410, QEW, Gardner Expressway, and the Don Valley Parkway, Toronto Self storage facilities really are boxed in by the most vibrant causeways in Canada. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Within Toronto there are tones of storage facilities scattered about all the annexes of the city. The junction holds the most with the DVP and the distillery district holding second place for the most unique and historical buildings used for self storage. Other areas like Parkdale, Bloor West, Liberty Village, and areas around High Park can be found with a fair amount of self storage facilities and make up a mix of older and new buildings.
    <br>
    <br>
    Due to the compactness of the downtown core, if you live in on Bloor, Queens Quay, or near the financial district, your options can be limited. Better luck for self storage facilities can be found in the outer areas like Cabbage Town, Midtown, and near Eglinton Avenue, Lawrence, and York Mills.
